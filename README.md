HW for Week 2 - VBA

#Tushar Makhija' comments

1. My code will work well on a Windows machine. On a mac, there may appear a dialogue box that I was not able to supress

2. My conditional formatting for yearly change is still red/green but sightly different than the one in the screenshot. I just liked this one better, can be easily changed

3. to run my code, run the subroutine named main1() . this will call in other subroutines which are below it in my .vbs file

4. this code will work on both the files
